## Happiness 幸福

You don’t have to love your job. Jobs are a way to make money. Many people live fine lives in okay jobs by using the money they make on things they care about.

你不必热爱你的工作。工作是一 种赚钱的方式。许多人通过将赚到的钱用在他们关心的事情上，过着美好的生活。





Sturgeon’s law states that 90% of everything is crap. If you dislike poetry, or fine art, or anything, it’s possible you’ve only ever seen the crap. Go looking!

斯特金定律指出，90% 的东西都是垃圾。如果你不喜欢诗歌、美术或其他任何东西，你可能只看过那些废话。去找吧！

People don’t realize how much they hate commuting. A nice house farther from work is not worth the fraction of your life you are giving to boredom and fatigue.

There’s some evidence that introverts and extroverts both benefit from being pushed to be more extroverted. Consider this the next time you aren’t sure if you feel like going out.

Done is better than perfect.

完成总比完美好。

Discipline is superior to motivation. The former can be trained, the latter is fleeting. You won’t be able to accomplish great things if you’re only relying on motivation.

纪律优于动力。前者可以训练，后者转瞬即逝。如果你只依靠动力，你将无法完成伟大的事情。

You can improve your communication skills with practice much more effectively than you can improve your intelligence with practice. If you’re not that smart but can communicate ideas clearly, you have a great advantage over everybody who can’t communicate clearly.

你可以通过练习来提高你的沟通技巧，而不是通过练习来提高你的智力。如果你不是那么聪明，但能清楚地传达想法，那么你比那些不能清晰沟通的人有很大的优势。

You do not live in a video game. There are no pop-up warnings if you’re about to do something foolish, or if you’ve been going in the wrong direction for too long. You have to create your own warnings.

你不生活在电子游戏中。如果您即将做一些愚蠢的事情，或者如果您已经朝着错误的方向前进太久，则不会弹出警告。您必须创建自己的警告。

Make accomplishing things as easy as possible. Find the easiest way to start exercising. Find the easiest way to start writing. People make things harder than they have to be and get frustrated when they can’t succeed. Try not to.

Cultivate a reputation for being dependable. Good reputations are valuable because they’re rare (easily destroyed and hard to rebuild). You don’t have to brew the most amazing coffee if your customers know the coffee will always be hot.

树立可靠的声誉。良好的声誉很有价值，因为它们很稀有（很容易被摧毁且难以重建）。如果您的客户知道咖啡永远是热的，那么您不必冲泡最美味的咖啡。

不要向同事或在网上抱怨你的伴侣。好处可以忽略不计，成本会摧毁你的一点灵魂。

After a breakup, cease all contact as soon as practical. The potential for drama is endless, and the potential for a good friendship is negligible. Wait a year before trying to be friends again.

分手后，尽快停止所有联系。戏剧的可能性是无穷无尽的，而建立良好友谊的可能性可以忽略不计。等一年后再尝试再次成为朋友。

解释问题是好的。通常在布置问题的过程中，会有一个解决方案出现。

Selfish people should listen to advice to be more selfless, selfless people should listen to advice to be more selfish. This applies to many things. Whenever you receive advice, consider its opposite as well. You might be filtering out the advice you need most.

如果您的工作是在计算机上完成的，请购买第二台显示器。更少的时间在窗口之间导航意味着更多的思考时间。

Establish clear rules about when to throw out old junk. Once clear rules are established, junk will probably cease to be a problem. This is because any rule would be superior to our implicit rules (“keep this broken stereo for five years in case I learn how to fix it”).

制定关于何时扔掉旧垃圾的明确规则。一旦建立了明确的规则，垃圾可能就不再是一个问题。这是因为任何规则都优于我们的隐含规则（“将这个坏掉的立体声音响保留五年，以防我学会如何修复它”）。

保持你的身份小。“我不是那种做这种事情的人”不是一个解释，而是一个陷阱。它阻止了书锻炼和男人跳舞。

Don’t confuse ‘doing a thing because I like it’ with ‘doing a thing because I want to be seen as the sort of person who does such things’.

In choosing between living with 0-1 people vs 2 or more people, remember that ascertaining responsibility will no longer be instantaneous with more than one roommate (“whose dishes are these?”).

在选择 0-1 人与 2 人或更多人住在一起时，请记住，确定责任将不再是与多个室友一起立即确定的（“这些是谁的菜？

When you ask people, “What’s your favorite book / movie / band?” and they stumble, ask them instead what book / movie / band they’re currently enjoying most. They’ll almost always have one and be able to talk about it.

当你问人们，“你最喜欢的书/电影/乐队是什么”时，他们磕磕绊绊地问他们目前最喜欢什么书/电影/乐队。他们几乎总是会有一个，并且能够谈论它。
